 This program simulates a demand paging handler in an operating system. 
 * The input is given as command line arguments: in the following order:
 * the machine size in words; the page size in words; the size of each process, i.e., the references are to virtual addresses;
   the ‘‘job mix’’, which determines A, B, and C, as described below; the number of references for each process;
 * the replacement algorithm, FIFO, RANDOM, or LRU.
 
 All output is printed to console.
